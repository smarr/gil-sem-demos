# GIL Impact Demos

This repo contains examples that show semantics differences between GIL and no-GIL Python.

The key properties include:
 - concurrency on PICs
 - impact on semantics with object shapes, i.e., hidden classes
 - impact on semantics with storage strategies
 - semantics around lists and list size, as well as other containers
