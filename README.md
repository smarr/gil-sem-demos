# GIL Impact Demos

This repo contains examples that show semantics differences between GIL and no-GIL Python.

The key properties include:
 - [ ] concurrency on PICs
 - [ ] impact on semantics with object shapes, i.e., hidden classes
 - [ ] impact on semantics with storage strategies
 - [x] semantics around contains/insert/delete/size on lists
 - [ ] semantics around contains/insert/delete/size on other containers
